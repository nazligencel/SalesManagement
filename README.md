<i><b>Reset Password</b></i></br>
A code is sent to the e-mail address of the user who forgets his password on the password renewal screen. Once the sent code is confirmed, a new password can be created.

<i><b>Login Screen</b></i></br>
The user registered on the login screen can log in with the registered e-mail address and password in the database.

<i><b>Customer Transactions</b></i></br>
After logging in with the correct e-mail address and password, the system is logged in. User can add, delete, edit customers on the first page. The requirement that the added customer's email address or phone be unique was also checked. A warning message is returned to the user. If any sale has been made to the selected customer, the customer is not allowed to be deleted.

<i><b>Category Operations</b></i></br>
In category operations, any category can be added, updated and deleted. Non-empty control operations and warning messages are also given.

<i><b>Product Management</b></i></br>
On the product page, the user can perform the necessary additions, deletions and updates regarding the product. Data type validation is done here.

<i><b>Sale Management</b></i></br>
In sales management, the user is provided to select the customer first. As soon as the customer is selected, the category box becomes active. When the category is selected, the products belonging to that category are selected from the product table. The number of spinner components to be sold from the selected product is modeled according to the stock amount of the selected product. The number is selected and then the add to cart button is clicked and the product is listed in the cart table. This is repeated for different categories and different products. If desired, the product can be deleted from the cart. When adding to the cart and removing it from the cart, the cart is completed, the sell button is pressed and the sale is completed. Messages are cleared and made available for the new client.

<i><b>Reports</b></i></br>
On the report page, the sales data of the desired date can be accessed according to the desired parameter. The model of the table is linked to the corresponding search text box. By pressing the pdf button, the table on the screen is converted to a pdf file. Details of sales are included in this pdf. General profit and loss information is in the lower left corner. This information is updated with each new sale.

<i><b>User Settings</b></i></br>
In the user settings section, the user can create a new password by changing the old password.
